# elite-mod-tau
Framework for the Tau implementation

Test Build operates by simply dragging the contents of the Test Build folder on top of an existing 2.9.11 Elite Mod Installation.

You must back up your Live installation first, as this build has a new Attrib SGA with it, so you can't simply switch Dev mode off and play as normal
